## 📋 Deployment Checklist

### **Prerequisites** ✅
- [x] AWS account with proper permissions
- [x] AWS CLI installed and configured
- [x] EB CLI installed (`pip install awsebcli`)
- [x] Node.js 18+ installed locally
- [x] Git repository ready

### **Pre-Deployment** ✅
- [x] Run `./deploy-prep.sh` to verify setup
- [x] Ensure frontend builds successfully
- [x] Test backend API endpoints locally
- [x] Verify all dependencies are installed

### **Deployment Steps** 📝
```bash
# 1. Prepare application
./deploy-prep.sh

# 2. Initialize EB (first time only)
eb init

# 3. Create environment
eb create youtube-audio-downloader-prod

# 4. Set environment variables
eb setenv NODE_ENV=production CORS_ORIGINS=*

# 5. Deploy
eb deploy

# 6. Open application
eb open
```

### **Post-Deployment** 📝
- [ ] Verify application loads correctly
- [ ] Test audio download functionality
- [ ] Check health endpoint (`/api/health`)
- [ ] Monitor CloudWatch logs
- [ ] Set up monitoring alerts

## 🔧 Configuration Summary

### **Environment Variables**
| Variable | Development | Production |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| `NODE_ENV` | `development` | `production` |
| `PORT` | `5001` | `8080` |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | `localhost:5173` | `*` or domain |

### **Architecture Changes**
| Component | Development | Production |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Frontend | Vite dev server (5173) | Served by Express |
| Backend | Express server (5001) | Express server (8080) |
| API Calls | `localhost:5001/api` | `/api` (relative) |
| Static Files | Vite assets | Express static serving |

### **AWS Resources**
- **EC2 Instance**: t3.small (minimum recommended)
- **Load Balancer**: Application Load Balancer
- **Auto Scaling**: 1-4 instances
- **Health Check**: `/api/health`
- **Platform**: Node.js 18 on Amazon Linux 2

## 🎯 Benefits of This Implementation

### **Cost Optimization**
- Single-server deployment reduces EC2 costs
- Efficient resource utilization
- Minimal AWS service usage

### **Performance**
- Frontend served directly by Express
- GZIP compression enabled
- Optimized static file serving
- Automatic FFmpeg installation

### **Scalability**
- Auto-scaling group configuration

- Horizontal scaling support

### **Maintainability**
- Environment-based configuration
- Automated build process
- Comprehensive monitoring

### **Security**
- Environment variable management
- CORS configuration
- HTTPS support ready
- Minimal attack surface

## 🚨 Important Notes

### **Production Considerations**
1. **CORS Origins**: Change `CORS_ORIGINS=*` to specific domain in production
2. **Instance Size**: Consider t3.medium for higher traffic
3. **Monitoring**: Set up CloudWatch alarms
4. **Backup**: Regular environment configuration exports
5. **Security**: Use AWS Certificate Manager for HTTPS

### **Cost Management**
- Monitor usage through AWS Cost Explorer
- Consider Reserved Instances for predictable workloads
- Implement auto-scaling policies
- Regular cost reviews

### **Troubleshooting**
- Use `eb logs` for application debugging
- Monitor CloudWatch for system metrics
- Check health dashboard regularly
- Test deployments in staging first
